Target ecosystems: GitHub and Gitea.\n\n## Research Complete\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- octo.nvim: GitHub-only, no Gitea support planned\n- gh vs tea: Very similar commands, easy to abstract\n- User workflow: zellij panes for agent + review (nvim/fugitive)\n- Core pain point: Context switching friction between review and agent feedback\n\n**MVP Approach:**\n- forge CLI wrapper (tools/forge) provides unified GitHub/Gitea interface\n- Agent creates PR, polls for comments asynchronously\n- User reviews in terminal (nvim/fugitive), adds comments via forge\n- Agent addresses feedback with --fixup commits for atomic hygiene\n- No headless automation yet - stay in existing zellij workflow\n\n**Completed:**\n- ✅ Added tea CLI for Gitea support (tools/default.nix)\n- ✅ Created forge wrapper with LCD commands (tools/forge)\n- ✅ Documented PR workflow in AGENTS.md\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Dog-food the PR workflow pattern (agent creates PR from this work)\n2. Test forge with actual GitHub authentication\n3. Evaluate polling cadence (manual check vs periodic)\n4. Consider pub/sub patterns (webhooks → Discord → agent) for Phase 2\n5. Research multi-agent per repo via worktrees (long-term)\n\n**Out of Scope (Separate Issues):**\n- #setup shell for agent tooling (llm-tools-bh9)\n- octo.nvim integration (GitHub-only, optional enhancement)\n- Neovim plugin for Gitea (no existing solution)\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-28T23:06:29.501820028-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T15:33:45.109868934-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-29T15:33:45.109868934-05:00","created_by":"cbarber","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"llm-tools-z4s","depends_on_id":"llm-tools-jqm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-29T10:56:00.57145679-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Solution: Add BWRAP_EXTRA_PATHS env var that agent shells and projects can extend. Example: BWRAP_EXTRA_PATHS='/home/user/.cargo:/home/user/.cache/go-build' converts to --bind mounts automatically.
