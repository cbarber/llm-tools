{"id":"llm-tools-ak0","title":"Refactor CLAUDE.local.md to AGENTS.md with CLAUDE.md symlink","description":"Reconcile CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md by making AGENTS.md the primary file with CLAUDE.md as a symlink. This consolidates documentation and follows beads convention. Will require updating CLAUDE file checking logic in shell setup to handle symlinks. Currently we check for CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md - need to add AGENTS.md to precedence and create CLAUDE.md symlink when appropriate.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T18:20:02.501412493-05:00","created_by":"cbarber","updated_at":"2025-12-27T18:20:02.501412493-05:00"}
{"id":"llm-tools-tze","title":"Extract shell hooks to separate script files","description":"Extract shell hooks from agents/*/default.nix into separate .sh files to avoid Nix string escaping issues (double-quote-quote-dollar-brace breaks tree-sitter), improve diff clarity, and follow existing setup-*.sh pattern. Benefits: better syntax highlighting, easier testing, cleaner version control.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T18:19:38.457290933-05:00","created_by":"cbarber","updated_at":"2025-12-27T18:19:54.282559573-05:00"}
{"id":"llm-tools-yyo","title":"Explore chroot for CLI agent startup constraints","description":"Investigate using chroot to constrain CLI agents on startup for better security and isolation. Requirements: provide /tmp access, use mktemp for agent work directory, remove work directory on exit (no symlink following). Benefits: prevent agents from accessing files outside project scope, temporary workspace cleanup, reduced security risk. Considerations: how to handle tool access (git, editors, etc), bind mounts for necessary directories, performance impact.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T19:05:06.440200388-05:00","created_by":"cbarber","updated_at":"2025-12-27T19:05:06.440200388-05:00"}
