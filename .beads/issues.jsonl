{"id":"llm-tools-0jy","title":"Add next-session handoff prompt to session completion template","description":"Problem: The 'Landing the Plane' section in AGENTS.md step 7 says 'Hand off - Provide context for next session' but doesn't specify the format. This causes agents to provide summaries TO the user instead of preparing a prompt FOR the next AI session, breaking continuity between sessions.\n\nProposed Solution:\nUpdate both agents/templates/default.md (shared template) and AGENTS.md (this repo's instructions) to clarify step 7 should produce a ready-to-paste prompt containing:\n- Current repository state (branch, commit hash, working tree status)\n- What was just completed (closed issues, commits pushed)\n- Ready issues with IDs and priorities\n- Important context for continuity\n\nExample format:\n```\n## Next Session Prompt\n\nCurrent State (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- Branch: main (abc1234)\n- Working tree: clean\n- Recent work: [summary]\n\nReady Issues:\n1. issue-id (P1): Title\n   - Key context\n\n2. issue-id (P2): Title\n   - Key context\n\nContext:\n- Important details for next session\n```\n\nThis ensures the next AI session has proper context without requiring the user to manually brief it.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T20:42:43.994565298-05:00","created_by":"cbarber","updated_at":"2025-12-27T20:45:09.286013179-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T20:45:09.286013179-05:00","close_reason":"Added explicit handoff prompt format to AGENTS.md and agents/templates/default.md"}
