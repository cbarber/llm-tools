{"id":"llm-tools-ak0","title":"Refactor CLAUDE.local.md to AGENTS.md with CLAUDE.md symlink","description":"Reconcile CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md by making AGENTS.md the primary file with CLAUDE.md as a symlink. This consolidates documentation and follows beads convention. Will require updating CLAUDE file checking logic in shell setup to handle symlinks. Currently we check for CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md - need to add AGENTS.md to precedence and create CLAUDE.md symlink when appropriate.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T18:20:02.501412493-05:00","created_by":"cbarber","updated_at":"2025-12-27T18:20:02.501412493-05:00"}
{"id":"llm-tools-bzj","title":"Support user-specific templates for CLAUDE/AGENTS.md","description":"Allow users to customize agent templates based on their username/GitHub handle. Potential approaches: 1) Nix flake variant: nix develop ~/src/llm-tools#claude-code.cbarber 2) Auto-detect from USER env var or git config user.name 3) Template directory structure: agents/claude-code/templates/{default,cbarber,etc}.md. Benefits: personalized instructions, team-specific workflows, easy to share common patterns. Depends on: llm-tools-ak0 (CLAUDE/AGENTS.md refactor). Consider: template precedence, fallback to default, documentation for creating custom templates.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-27T19:10:43.280685476-05:00","created_by":"cbarber","updated_at":"2025-12-27T19:10:43.280685476-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"llm-tools-bzj","depends_on_id":"llm-tools-ak0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T19:10:52.254480336-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"llm-tools-yyo","title":"Explore chroot for CLI agent startup constraints","description":"Investigate using chroot to constrain CLI agents on startup for better security and isolation. Requirements: provide /tmp access, use mktemp for agent work directory, remove work directory on exit (no symlink following). Benefits: prevent agents from accessing files outside project scope, temporary workspace cleanup, reduced security risk. Considerations: how to handle tool access (git, editors, etc), bind mounts for necessary directories, performance impact.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T19:05:06.440200388-05:00","created_by":"cbarber","updated_at":"2025-12-27T19:05:06.440200388-05:00"}
