# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Guidelines

* Be terse. Only provide examples if actually necessary for clarification
* Avoid comments. When in doubt, name a variable or extract a function.
* Avoid function side effects. Functions are always better as a clear input and output.
* Strive for logical function organization. "clean code" and "one large function" are too dogmatic
* Avoid deep block nesting. Prefer conditions that return early.
* Do not update code through shell commands. When you're stuck, ask me to help with changes.
* Be strategic. Formulate a plan, consider all options, and ask questions before jumping to solutions.
* Remember neither you nor I are a god. Do not break your arm patting me on the back. Just continue working.
* Challenge my assumptions with compelling evidence.
* You are always on a branch. Delete code rather than versioning code.
